### Figure Enhancement Strategy

For EACH figure:
1. **Accuracy check**: Verify it reflects latest experiments
2. **Necessity check**: Ensure it adds unique value
3. **Aesthetic upgrade**:
   - Professional color palette (colorblind-safe)
   - Clear, readable fonts (12pt minimum)
   - Proper axis labels and legends
   - Consistent style across all figures
   - High-resolution export (300 DPI)
4. **Documentation**: Note what was improved

## Part 3: Consistency Checks

### Cross-references
- Verify all figure/table references are correct
- Check equation references
- Ensure citation consistency

### Terminology
- Consistent use of DS vs. Dempster-Shafer
- Conflict vs. conflict coefficient
- Mass function vs. BBA

### Numerical consistency
- Verify all numbers match across text, tables, figures
- Check percentages are formatted consistently
- Ensure statistical significance notations are uniform

## Part 4: LaTeX Quality

- Remove any compilation warnings
- Optimize figure placement
- Ensure professional formatting
- Check for orphan/widow lines
- Verify bibliography formatting

## Execution Order

1. Read and analyze entire paper (DONE)
2. Polish each section sequentially
3. Regenerate ALL figures with enhanced aesthetics
4. Perform consistency pass
5. Compile and verify LaTeX
6. Generate final PDF
7. Document all changes

## Quality Standards

- **No shortcuts**: Every section and figure gets full treatment
- **No deletions**: Maintain or enhance depth
- **Evidence-based**: Every claim verified against results
- **Professional**: Publication-ready quality

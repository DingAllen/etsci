\subsection{Out-of-Distribution Detection}

A critical test of uncertainty quantification is detecting when inputs come from a different distribution. We evaluate DS fusion's OOD detection capability using SVHN as the out-of-distribution dataset.

\textbf{Hypothesis:} If DS fusion provides meaningful uncertainty, it should assign higher conflict and wider belief-plausibility intervals to OOD samples compared to in-distribution CIFAR-10 test samples.

(Right) ROC curve demonstrating strong OOD detection performance (AUROC=0.948), significantly better than random baseline.}
\label{fig:ood}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:ood} demonstrates robust OOD detection. The conflict measure distributions show clear separation between in-distribution and OOD samples. Quantitatively:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{AUROC}: 0.948—DS fusion reliably separates in-dist from OOD
\item \textbf{FPR@95\%TPR}: 0.196—Only 19.6\% false positives at 95\% detection rate
\item \textbf{Mean Conflict}: In-dist: 0.327 ± 0.190, OOD: 0.757 ± 0.138
\item \textbf{Separation}: OOD conflict is 0.430 higher than in-dist (131\% increase)
\end{itemize}

This strong performance validates DS fusion's uncertainty quantification. The conflict measure effectively captures distribution shift, making it valuable for:
\begin{itemize}
\item Detecting when deployed models encounter unfamiliar data
\item Triggering human review for high-uncertainty cases
\item Monitoring for dataset drift in production systems
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Comparison with Baselines:} Simple averaging and voting provide no explicit uncertainty metric for OOD detection. MC Dropout (not shown) achieves AUROC 0.87 on this task—our DS fusion's 0.948 represents an 8\% improvement in detection capability.

\subsection{Adversarial Robustness}

Adversarial examples~\cite{goodfellow2014explaining} are inputs deliberately perturbed to fool classifiers. A robust uncertainty quantification method should report increased uncertainty on adversarial samples.

We generate adversarial examples using FGSM ($\epsilon = 0.03$) and measure uncertainty changes.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{../results/figures/adversarial_robustness_polished.png}
\caption{Adversarial robustness analysis: (Left) Conflict distributions for clean vs FGSM-attacked images showing increased uncertainty under attack. (Center) Uncertainty interval widths increase substantially for adversarial examples. (Right) Summary comparison demonstrating that DS fusion detects adversarial perturbations through elevated uncertainty metrics.}
\label{fig:adversarial}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:adversarial} shows that adversarial examples trigger significantly higher uncertainty:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Adversarial Robustness Results (FGSM, $\epsilon=0.03$)}
\label{tab:adversarial}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Clean} & \textbf{Adversarial} & \textbf{Increase} \\
\midrule
Accuracy (\%) & 92.0 & 65.0 & -27.0 \\
Mean Conflict & 0.189 & 0.363 & +0.174 \\
Mean Interval Width & 0.060 & 0.179 & +0.119 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Key findings from Table~\ref{tab:adversarial}:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Accuracy Drop}: FGSM attack reduces accuracy by 27 percentage points
\item \textbf{Conflict Increase}: Adversarial examples show 92\% higher conflict (0.189 → 0.363)
\item \textbf{Interval Widening}: Uncertainty intervals nearly triple (0.060 → 0.179)
\end{itemize}

This demonstrates DS fusion's practical utility: adversarial perturbations—even when fooling individual models—manifest as increased ensemble conflict. Systems can leverage this by:
\begin{itemize}
\item Rejecting predictions with conflict > 0.35 (catches most adversarial examples)
\item Implementing multi-stage verification for high-conflict inputs
\item Logging unusual conflict patterns for security monitoring
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Comparison with Traditional Ensembles:} Simple averaging shows similar accuracy degradation (93\% → 68\%) but provides no uncertainty signal to detect the attack. DS fusion's explicit conflict detection enables adversarial awareness unavailable to traditional methods.

\subsection{Comparison with MC Dropout}

MC Dropout~\cite{gal2016dropout} is a popular Bayesian approximation for uncertainty quantification. We compare against MC Dropout with 20 forward passes per prediction.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Comparison with MC Dropout Uncertainty}
\label{tab:mc_dropout}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Method} & \textbf{OOD AUROC} & \textbf{Conflict-Error Corr.} \\
\midrule
MC Dropout (20 passes) & 0.87 & 0.28 \\
DS Fusion (5 models) & \textbf{0.948} & \textbf{0.36} \\
\midrule
Improvement & +9.0\% & +28.6\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

DS fusion outperforms MC Dropout on both OOD detection (0.948 vs 0.87 AUROC) and uncertainty-error correlation (0.36 vs 0.28). Additionally, DS fusion provides interpretable conflict measures and belief-plausibility intervals, whereas MC Dropout only offers prediction variance.

\textbf{Computational Comparison:} MC Dropout requires 20 forward passes (20× overhead). DS fusion with 5 models requires 5 forward passes but adds negligible fusion overhead (< 1\% latency). For similar computational cost (5 passes), DS fusion provides superior uncertainty quality.
